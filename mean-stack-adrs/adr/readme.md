# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains the ADRs for the MEAN-Stack-Docker-Master application used and edited by Drew Alessi. The reason for creating the program is for College of Charleston's class CSCI-459 (Enterprise Architecture) and will be submitted on GitHub as a Git Repository to enable rollback capabilities as well as providing public access to the project.

The template the project is based on is from [Michael Nygard's template](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record/blob/master/adr_template_by_michael_nygard.md).

The attached ADR's explain how the project makes use of REST, CRUD, and ACID/BASE. They also explain the context of why their being used, as well as how the decision was made to use them.

If it is unclear on where to find the web page using the attached database, it can be found on localhost:4200.
