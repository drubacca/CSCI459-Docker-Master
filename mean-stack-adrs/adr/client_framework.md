# Choice of Client Framework

Angular

# Status: accepted

# Context: 

Angular is one of the most popular Javascript frameworks available. Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web. Angular combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges. Angular empowers developers to build applications that live on the web, mobile, or the desktop.

# Decision:

Angular was chosen because it seemed to be the most practical frameworks to complete the assignment given. I was originally coding the database index in PHP and implementing SQL code for the database. After doing some further investigation I discovered Angular and eventhough it had a tough learning curve I feel as though it will only become easier to understand in the future and can help me in a future career. Angular provides many unique features that are built in.

Angular composes it files with a default Model-View-Controller layout. It uses HTML files for the View, which are linked to a typescript class that then feeds into the component's business logic (which serves as the Controller). It also uses built-in services to control/modify the Model and update data automatically with each change made to the code.


# Consequences: 

Angular is a completely new system for me to understand and unfortunately it has a rough learning curve.
