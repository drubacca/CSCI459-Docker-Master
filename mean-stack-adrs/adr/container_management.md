# Choice of Container Management

Docker

# Status: accepted

# Context: 

Docker is a useful tool that is implemented to make it easier when creating, deploying, and/or running application packaged inside a container. It helps to better oversee and manage the contents of the project. Docker also allows each of the individual pieces of the project to function independently while still working as a whole.

# Decision:

Docker was chosen as the container management system because it is easily runnable through command line. It allows developers to easily manage and organize their code in a project. It also allows an easy way to store and share code during a project. Docker is much easier to operate opposed to a Virtual Machine. Additionally, docker makes deployment of a large directory/file simple with the use of cloud container hosting. 

# Consequences: 

Docker has many pros due to it's lightweight nature, however, it can see to have limited functionality when compared to a Virtual Machine. Docker also can be a confusing to those who aren't familiar with command line, as well as those who have never heard of a container manager before.
